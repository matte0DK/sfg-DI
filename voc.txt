THE IoC CONTAINER
-----------------
Responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects.
The IoC container gets information from the XML file and works accordingly.
The main tasks performed by IoC container are:

- to instantiate the application class
- to configure the object
- to assemble the dependencies between the objects

There are two types of IoC containers:

- BeanFactory
- ApplicationContext

! The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface.
It adds some extra functionality than BeanFactory such as simple integration with Spring's AOP, message resource handling (for I18N),
event propagation, application layer specific context (e.g. WebApplicationContext) for web application.
So it is better to use ApplicationContext than BeanFactory !


WHAT IS A SPRING BEAN?
----------------------
1. Spring Bean
In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans.
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

2. Inversion of Control
Simply put, Inversion of Control, or IoC for short, is a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them.
This object delegates the job of constructing such dependencies to an IoC container.
